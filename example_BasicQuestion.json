        "hallucinated_answer": "A Generation-Estate Skipping Trust (GEST) combines the benefits of a Generation-Skipping Trust with estate tax deferral strategies. By placing assets in a GEST, the grantor can bypass both their children's estate tax liability and the generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT), as the trust's structure allows distributions to grandchildren while locking in the estate's FMV at the time of funding. This dual-layer protection is achieved through a qualified terminal interest property (QTIP) election within the trust, ensuring tax efficiency across multiple generations.",

        "hallucinated_answer": "The Keynesian-Golden Rule Model is a hybrid macroeconomic framework that integrates Keynesian demand management with the fiscal discipline of the Golden Rule. It prescribes countercyclical deficit spending during recessions (per Keynesian principles) while limiting structural deficits to public investment (per the Golden Rule), ensuring debt sustainability. The model was formalized in the 1990s to address critiques of pure Keynesianism, notably by blending automatic stabilizers with capital budgeting rules. Empirical studies suggest it reduces volatility without compromising intergenerational equity, though critics argue it overestimates governments' ability to distinguish productive investment.",
